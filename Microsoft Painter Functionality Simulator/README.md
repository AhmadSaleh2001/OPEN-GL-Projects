Microsoft Painter Functionality Simulator

This project is a simulator for Microsoft Painter functionality, created using OPEN GL Freeglut. The program allows users to simulate various functionalities of Microsoft Painter, including dragging and dropping shapes (rectangle, circle, or triangle) and resizing shapes by using the '+' and '-' keys on the keyboard.

Functionalities:

- Drag and Drop Shapes: Users can drag and drop shapes, such as rectangles, circles, and triangles, onto the canvas. This feature provides an interactive interface for easy manipulation of shapes.
- Shape Activation: When a shape is clicked, it becomes active, allowing users to perform further actions on the selected shape.
- Shape Resizing: When a shape is active, users can dynamically change its size by clicking the '+' or '-' keys on the keyboard. This functionality provides a convenient way to increase or decrease the size of the shape.

Requirements:

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later
- Freeglut library installed on your system

Usage:

1. Interact with the program using the following controls:
   - Drag and Drop: Use the mouse to click and drag shapes onto the canvas.
   - Shape Activation: Click on a shape to activate it.
   - Shape Resizing: When a shape is active, press the '+' key to increase its size or the '-' key to decrease its size.
