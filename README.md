OpenGL 2D Projects with C++ and FreeGLUT Library

This repository contains a collection of 2D projects developed using the C++ programming language and the FreeGLUT library. These projects were created during the fall semester of the academic year 2022-2023. Each project folder contains a video showcasing the project's functionality.

Project List:

1. Fishbowl Visualizer
   - Description: This project visualizes a fishbowl with swimming fishes using OpenGL and FreeGLUT.

2. Algorithm Visualizer
   - Description: This project implements various sorting and searching algorithms and provides a visual representation of how these algorithms work step-by-step.

3. Microsoft Painter Functionality Simulator
   - Description: This project simulates some functionalities of Microsoft Painter, such as drawing shapes

4. Digital Board Visualizer
   - Description: Simulating AND, OR, and XOR logic gates.

5. Simple Subway Game
   - Description: This project is a simple subway game where the player controls a character and avoids obstacles while collecting points. It includes basic collision detection and scoring functionality.

6. Catch The Letter
   - Description: In this project, letters fall from the top of the screen, and the player needs to catch specific letters while avoiding others. It tests the player's reflexes and accuracy.

7. Eye Tracker
   - Description: A program with a face that tracks mouse position using eye movement.
8. Snake Game
   - Description: This project is a classic snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow in length. It includes score tracking and collision detection.
