Functionalities:

- Gate Simulation: Users can simulate various logic gates, including AND, OR, and XOR gates, on the digital board.
- Visual Representation: The program visually represents the inputs and outputs of the logic gates on the digital board.
- Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the digital board by providing inputs and observing the corresponding outputs.

Requirements:

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later
- Freeglut library installed on your system

Usage:

1. Interact with the program by observing the digital board and providing inputs to the logic gates.
