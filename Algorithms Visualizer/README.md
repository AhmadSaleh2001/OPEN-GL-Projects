DFS BFS A* Visualizer using OpenGL and FreeGLUT

This project is a Visualizer for Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* search algorithms implemented using OpenGL and FreeGLUT. The program allows you to visualize these algorithms in action on a grid-based graph.

Features:

- Algorithm Visualization: The visualizer demonstrates the step-by-step execution of DFS, BFS, and A* search algorithms on a grid graph. It highlights the visited nodes and shows the path found by each algorithm.
- Interactive Controls: Users can interact with the visualizer using mouse and keyboard controls.
  - Press 'X' to generate a random grid.
  - Press 'R' to reset the grid.
  - Left-click to select the start point (colored red).
  - Left-click again to select the end point (colored green).
  - Left-click on any other cell to place a wall (colored black).
- Algorithm Selection: Users can choose between DFS, BFS, and A* algorithms to visualize their respective search processes.
- Exit Option: Users can choose 4 to quit the program.

Requirements:

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later
- FreeGLUT library installed on your system

Usage:

1. Interact with the program using the following controls:
   - Press 'X' to generate a random grid.
   - Press 'R' to reset the grid.
   - Left-click to select the start point (colored red).
   - Left-click again to select the end point (colored green).
   - Left-click on any other cell to place a wall (colored black).
   - Choose one of the algorithms (1 - DFS, 2 - BFS, 3 - A*) by entering the corresponding number.
   - To start the algorithm search, right-click on the mouse.

2. Observe the visualization of the selected algorithm on the grid graph. The visited nodes and the path will be displayed as the algorithm progresses.
